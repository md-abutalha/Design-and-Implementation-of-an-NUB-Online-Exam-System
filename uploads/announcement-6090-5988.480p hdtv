Previously on "Vikings..."

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:03,531
We have built a new boat.

3
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:06,068
For the first time, we can go west.

4
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:08,504
Countless riches await us.

5
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,472
Siggy: Our enemies are everywhere.

6
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:12,207
They cannot prevail.

7
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,075
Ragnar: The Earl knows
nothing about our new boat.

8
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,077
Warrior: He could kill us
for disobeying his orders.

9
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:17,946
Have you got the balls to join us?

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,247
Knut: They have set sail.

11
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:20,815
Earl Haraldson: They'll
never be heard from again.

12
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:22,216
Knut: What if Ragnar is right?

13
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:25,197
There are no lands to the west!

14
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:26,923
Athelstan: They've come. They're here.

15
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:28,457
Father Cuthbert: Who is here?

16
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,993
Cenwulf: Hell - and all its devils!

17
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:33,929
(Terrified screams, weapons clank)

18
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,929
Athelstan: (Speaking old norse)

19
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,865
How do you speak our language?

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,032
Rollo: Why have you not killed this one?

21
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:39,802
He is worth more alive.

22
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:42,038
Rollo: Take what you will.
This is what we came for.

Hello!

44
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,790
You are Ragnar Lothbrok's son,

45
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:42,891
Bjorn.

46
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:45,894
I remember you from the thing.

47
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,496
Yes.

48
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:49,264
Where is your father?

49
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,433
Lagertha: Bjorn? Who are you talking to?

50
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,505
Svein: I was just asking your son

51
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,475
where Ragnar Lothbrok might be?

52
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:01,043
He's gone fishing.

53
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:03,245
Svein: Oh! Fishing.

54
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,882
He's gone fishing.

55
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:10,194
Yes, fishing.

56
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,857
When will he return?

57
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,160
I don't know.

58
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:23,932
Svein: In which case I must
take someone back as surety,

59
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:24,901
just in case.

60
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:28,971
In case...?

61
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:33,008
In case your husband has not gone fishing!

62
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:45,921
You! Come!

63
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:50,425
Come!

64
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:02,237
You have to come with me.

65
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:04,473
If you don't obey this order,

66
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:08,110
the Earl will never give you an arm-ring!

67
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,113
I'll come.

68
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,483
Svein: Good.

69
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:17,786
Then let's be on our way.

70
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,455
Ingigerd: What are you doing?
Where are you taking my son?

71
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:22,991
Svein: He'll be quite safe, woman.

72
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:27,862
I bid you all a good day.

73
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,071
(Gulls cry)

74
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:44,947
Ragnar: (Quietly) We did it, brother.

75
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,450
Yes, brother, we did.

76
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:53,922
Let's just hope the Earl sees it that way.

77
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:56,992
Yeah.

78
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:14,943
What is your name?

79
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:18,580
Athelstan.

80
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:21,963
I am Ragnar Lothbrok.

81
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:26,765
What was that place called?

82
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:31,693
Lindisfarne.

83
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:32,927
England?

84
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,797
Yes.

85
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,302
It was foretold that divine punishment

86
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:43,538
would fall upon God's chosen people

87
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:45,807
for all our grievous sins,

88
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,344
and so it has happened.

89
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:53,414
And that is why I am here.

90
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,580
(Chuckles) No.

91
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:59,921
You are here because I spared your life.

92
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:04,826
Why did you spare my life?

93
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,935
I don't know yet.

94
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:19,008
(Birds chirp)

00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:32,921

(Low hum of chatter)

99
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,020
Athelstan: Ragnar Lothbrok!

100
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:06,922
What is it?

101
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,293
Brother Cenwulf here, beside me,

102
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:13,728
I think he's dead.

103
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,307
Ragnar: You're right.

104
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:27,375
Leif.

105
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:38,753
(Body splashes, water bubbles)

106
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:51,733
(Frightened sobs)

107
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:56,404
(Chuckles)

108
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,842
May God rest your soul, brother Cenwulf.

109
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,845
E nomine patri, e filii,

110
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:07,382
et spiritus sancti. Amen.

111
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:10,518
Yeah!

112
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:22,764
(Crowing victoriously)

113
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:49,924
(Loud buzz of excited chatter)

114
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:54,429
(Horn bellows)

115
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,539
(Loud buzz of excited chatter)

00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:05,807
(Horn bellows)

117
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,746
We'll drink well tonight, my friend.

118
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:13,848
Ahhh.

119
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,423
Ellisef: Erik!

120
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,690
Oh, thank the gods!

121
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,693
Erik: And not alone! Look!

122
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:27,962
We've brought slaves to sell.

123
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:29,697
But there's more, woman.

124
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,632
More things of gold and silver

125
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:34,736
than you and I have ever seen before,

126
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,505
nor anyone else here in Kattegat.

127
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,873
(Loud buzz of chatter)

128
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,414
Man: Ragnar Lothbrok, welcome back.

129
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:51,486
We know you sailed west
across the open ocean

130
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,488
and found land and plunder,

131
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:55,256
as you promised.

132
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:59,026
So let no man say any more
that it is not possible,

133
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:01,396
and we salute and praise you.

134
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,431
(Crowd cheers)

135
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:07,301
(Horn bellows)

136
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,922
Knut. You're too late.

137
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,559
You missed the boat.

138
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:33,960
I came to tell you

139
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,431
that Earl Haraldson summons you

140
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,031
to attend him in the great hall.

141
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,937
It will be a pleasure.

142
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:46,641
Man: Well done, Ragnar!

143
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:47,943
Ragnar: Are you coming, Knut?

144
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:50,778
(Crowd cheers)

145
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:06,294
(Excited chatter)

146
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:23,311
Ragnar: My lord,

147
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:27,548
it was easy to take all of these things.

148
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,651
The priests in their temple,

149
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,653
they had no weapons.

150
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,589
They were like babies.

151
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,827
Here is one of their priests.

152
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:43,798
We captured several of
them to sell for slaves.

153
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:48,369
It must be true

154
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:52,340
that there are many more
such holy places in england

155
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,042
and other lands to the west

156
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,513
likewise filled with such treasure,

157
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:03,784
and to sail there will benefit us all.

158
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,621
(Excited murmurs)

159
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:17,732
Earl Haraldson: How did you
find this place of great riches

160
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,334
when all before you had failed?

161
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:22,837
My lord,

162
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:28,676
we were more fortunate than others.

163
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,779
We had Thor on our side.

164
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,881
Crowd: Thor. Thor. Thor.

165
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:38,352
(Snorts) Yes.

166
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,324
Then you were indeed fortunate.

167
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:47,358
But you understand that
all this belongs to me,

168
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:49,897
by right.

169
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:55,836
Ragnar: My lord, me and
Floki paid for the boat.

170
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:59,407
Surely we are entitled to... some reward,

171
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:00,808
and my crew...

172
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:03,377
Earl Haraldson: You want me to pay you

173
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:07,582
when you took these things
as easily as from babies?

174
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:08,649
(Crowd laughs)

175
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:25,832
Earl Haraldson: Here's
what I've decided to do...

176
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,335
(Doors open)

177
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,638
Each one of you can take one thing

178
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,306
from this haul.

179
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:34,875
One?

180
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:37,678
Earl Haraldson: Yes. And you'll still
be richer than you were before.

181
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,318
Now, all the world can see

182
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,822
how magnanimous and generous is your lord,

183
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,326
especially since you disobeyed me.

184
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,897
So, Ragnar Lothbrok,

185
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:01,669
what will you choose?

186
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:17,418
(Crowd laughs)

187
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,008
Ragnar: I will take the
priest for my slave.

188
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:46,415
The priest?

189
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:52,386
(Siggy laughs out loud
and everyone joins in)

190
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:01,395
Granted.

191
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:12,373
Rollo: Why did you do that?

192
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:15,476
Why did you give everything away so easily?

193
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:16,911
We wasted our time.

194
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:21,382
I never should have believed in you.

195
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,818
Ragnar: He was looking for
an excuse to kill us.

196
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,586
Why would we go to Valhalla

197
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:29,490
after such miserable and pointless deaths?

198
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,292
Brother, believe me,

199
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:36,864
this is not the end,
it's just the beginning.

200
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,344
Well...

201
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:52,347
At least we didn't give
everything away so easily.

202
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,317
That's your one thing?

203
00:15:57,452 --> 00:16:00,721
How should he ever find out?

204
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:01,889
You idiot!

205
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,926
Would odin expect us to
do anything so stupid?

206
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:11,866
Rollo: You have your odin and I have mine.

207
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:16,202
Ragnar: Why don't you go get drunk,

208
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:17,971
spend all this on whores.

209
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:20,241
Make sure the Earl really finds out

210
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:22,809
that you stole from him.

211
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,318
(Silver clinks)

212
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:49,370
(Jewels jingle)

213
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,081
What a hoard is this!

214
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,469
What a hoard it is.

215
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:09,022
Siggy: See what you've done, my lord?

216
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,891
Never doubt your power.

217
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:13,259
With just a few words,

218
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:17,264
you stripped Ragnar Lothbrok
of all his treasure.

219
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:20,067
He's nothing to you,

220
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,903
and you are all power,

221
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:26,060
all authority.

222
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,478
You can have whatever you want.

223
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,900
(Heavy, passionate breathing)

224
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:24,499
(Dog barks, goats bleat)

225
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,507
(Chickens cluck)

226
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:47,189
(Clucking) (Startled gasp)

227
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:48,789
Gyda: They told me you'd come home!

228
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,226
Bjorn: Father! You're home!

229
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:53,627
Ragnar: Little man...

230
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:56,364
Bjorn: Did you reach the west?

231
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,344
So...

232
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:12,781
Where's all the treasure you promised?

233
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:15,650
The Earl took it all for himself.

234
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:20,655
But I found it, and it filled the boat.

235
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,092
(Laughs)

236
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,128
I believe you.

237
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:27,763
You ought to believe me.

238
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:31,733
This is a priest from
the temple to prove it.

239
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:34,069
Priest! This is my family.

240
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:36,672
His name is Athelstan.

241
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:42,110
Although he's a foreigner,
he speaks our language,

242
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,712
don't you?

243
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:44,780
A little, yes.

244
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:51,253
Bjorn: What is wrong with your head?

245
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:55,157
When we become monks, they cut our hair.

246
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,159
It marks us out.

247
00:19:57,194 --> 00:20:01,129
Gyda: If you're a priest,
which God do you like best?

248
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,398
There is only one God.

249
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,670
Ragnar: Here, you can touch him.

250
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,306
Bjorn: Are we keeping him?

251
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:13,441
Gyda: Hello.

252
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,579
I've missed your smell and your body.

253
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:24,186
Bjorn: Why do you wear this?

254
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,655
Athelstan: All monks do.

255
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,227
(Playful giggling)

256
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,662
Bjorn: Look at his feet.

257
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:36,631
(Heavy breathing)

258
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,401
(Athelstan quietly reads aloud)

259
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:51,213
(Heavy breathing, thumping)

260
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,783
(Quietly reading aloud)

261
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,664
Ragnar: (Whispering) Athelstan.

262
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:15,367
Athelstan, we want to ask you something.

263
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,582
Come and join us, priest.

264
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:24,679
Ragnar: Come on.

265
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:31,152
Don't you want to?

266
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:33,332
You'll enjoy it.

267
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:34,400
I am a monk.

268
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:38,538
I have taken vows of celibacy.

269
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:40,606
I cannot touch a woman.

270
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:43,876
I never have.

271
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,394
Wouldn't you like to?

272
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,366
It would be a sin.

273
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:09,603
Who would know?

274
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:13,674
God would know.

275
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:17,944
Lagertha: What if he looked the other way?

276
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:22,549
(Murmurs a prayer)

277
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:31,824
Go to sleep then... with your God.

278
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:41,534
(Giggling)

279
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:53,045
(Wind gusts, bird cries)

280
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:56,882
(Water laps at the shore)

281
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,492
(Dog barks in distance)

282
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:09,763
(Water splashes)

283
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,954
(Sobs in despair)

284
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,590
(Water drips)

285
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:44,997
Bjorn: Is this what you wanted?
There are so many...

286
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,617
Gyda: Bjorn, where are you going?

287
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:10,756
(Water splashes lightly)

288
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,331
(Blade scrapes)

289
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:29,508
(Grunts in pain)

290
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:36,649
(Bjorn laughs)

291
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:42,521
(Bjorn laughs)

292
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:43,856
Time for breakfast.

293
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:45,958
(Gyda laughs)

294
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,598
(Seabird cries)

295
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:53,400
Boy: Agh!

296
00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,705
(Grunts of effort)

297
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,900
Earl Haraldson: What age are you, boy?

298
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,903
Boy: Thirteen.

299
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:10,372
Haraldson: Thirteen.

300
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:12,774
The age my boy would have been.

301
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:18,446
The men will soon be going
on the summer raids,

302
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,447
are you looking forward to joining them?

303
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,184
Boy: I dream of it.

304
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:26,488
I'm already a good fighter,
like my father was.

305
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,523
Haraldson: That's why I chose you,

306
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,226
because you're broad and strong.

307
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:37,532
(Boy grunts)

308
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:40,635
That's deep enough.

309
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:45,373
Svein: Come.

310
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:58,253
(Treasure clatters and clinks)

311
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:10,765
Why are you burying all this treasure?

312
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,801
Don't you know anything, boy?

313
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,702
Svein: Odin promises that
a man will have the use

314
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:16,238
of everything he has hoarded up

315
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:18,240
after he is dead

316
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,342
and wakes up again in Valhalla.

317
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:23,845
But the hoard needs protection,

318
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,147
somebody to look after it...

319
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:29,317
In this life... and the next.

320
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:40,428
You've already seen
enough of this life, boy.

321
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,696
Aghhh! Oh!

322
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:47,736
(Strained grunting)

323
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:03,753
(Tired exhales)

324
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,269
(Grunts of effort)

325
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,143
(Dog barks)

326
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:29,644
(Athelstan burps)

327
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,646
No more.

328
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:34,583
Ragnar: We don't like those in our house

329
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,718
to go hungry or thirsty.

330
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,492
(Cups clink)

331
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:50,231
I am very curious about england.

332
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:51,599
Does it have one king

333
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:54,302
who rules over the whole country?

334
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:56,137
(Drunken laugh)

335
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:02,677
There are four kingdoms

336
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:06,147
with four kings.

337
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,653
You landed in the kingdom of Northumbria.

338
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:15,490
The king of Northumbria is called Aelle.

339
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,362
He is a great king.

340
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:21,796
A powerful king.

341
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:25,567
Then why did his men not
protect your temple?

342
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:27,435
(Chuckles)

343
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,537
Before you came,

344
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:32,574
we had no need to protect our monastery.

345
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,709
We lived in peace.

346
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:39,547
Everyone respected it as a place of God.

347
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:46,121
Why does your God need
silver and gold, hmm?

348
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:50,725
He must be greedy... (Laughs)

349
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:53,461
Like loki!

350
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:57,465
We have greedy gods too.

351
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:00,735
My God is not greedy.

352
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:06,174
His kingdom is not of this world.

353
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:09,711
Then why is his kingdom
so full of treasure?

354
00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:12,914
Christian people give away their riches

355
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:17,152
to the churches and monasteries

356
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,487
in order to save their souls.

357
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:23,591
What are their souls?

358
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:27,128
(Fire crackles)

359
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:34,235
I want to learn some of your language.

360
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:38,907
Will you teach me, priest?

361
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:41,377
(Cups clink)

362
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:47,549
(Seagulls cry)

363
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:56,424
(Low hum of Finnish traders
haggling in the market)

364
00:29:56,425 --> 00:30:00,128
(Sound of metal clashing as it's hammered)

365
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:21,182
(Coins clink)

366
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:23,151
Svein: You. Come.

367
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:31,326
Earl Haraldson: Ragnar Lothbrok.

368
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,194
My lord.

369
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,296
And how do you find your new slave?

370
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,499
Hmm...

371
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:41,533
I find him very useful,
as you will discover.

372
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:45,173
So what do you want?

373
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,575
Ragnar: I want to sail west again.

374
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:49,277
I have spoken at great lengths

375
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:51,579
with my Christian slave.

376
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,215
He is not a stupid person,

377
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,618
however stupid his God is.

378
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,486
He has traveled a great deal,

379
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,586
and he has told me

380
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:02,824
that there are many countries to the west.

381
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,860
He has also told me about his england,

382
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:09,790
about his kings and his customs.

383
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:14,077
Earl Haraldson: And what are
we to do with his customs?

384
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,045
Ragnar: He has informed me of a large town,

385
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,749
near to the temple that we raided before.

386
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,918
And in this town there are other temples,

387
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,853
and surely other riches.

388
00:31:24,689 --> 00:31:27,023
Athelstan: No! I was lying!
There's nothing there!

389
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,992
Ragnar: Shhh!

390
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:30,894
You see?

391
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,797
This town is clearly worth a visit.

392
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:37,768
Give us back our boat.

393
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:39,970
Let us go there and find out.

394
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:42,039
What do you have to lose?

395
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:44,775
Any plunder we take will
be yours to do with

396
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,143
as you please.

397
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,243
Earl Haraldson: I could go there myself.

398
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,080
Ragnar yes, you could, my lord,

399
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:52,516
but why put yourself in danger?

400
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:54,817
Why not leave it to someone

401
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:58,255
who has more... experience of this journey,

402
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:02,526
and someone who is more expendable?

403
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:06,496
(Coins clink)

404
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:18,875
Very well.

405
00:32:19,877 --> 00:32:23,080
I sanction this raid... on one condition:

406
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:26,683
A warrior I trust goes with you.

407
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:28,051
Knut.

408
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,822
You will go with him for my sake.

409
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,725
Knut: Trust me, lord.

410
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,562
I will take very close
care of your interests.

411
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:43,967
Athelstan: O lord, forgive
me for what I have done.

412
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,535
You will not regret this.

413
00:32:56,614 --> 00:33:00,017
He's found a new way to navigate the sea.

414
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,286
Find out what it is.

415
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:10,527

416
00:33:33,785 --> 00:33:34,719
(Slices rope)

417
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:38,588
Ragnar: Run away if you want.

418
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:42,526
(Dog barks in distance)

419
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:49,099
(Wood frame creaks)

420
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,819
Ragnar: I have the Earl's
permission to sail back to england.

421
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:12,823
I want to leave as soon as possible.

422
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:18,862
How soon is that?

423
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:20,197
Ragnar: Tomorrow.

424
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,672
(Sighs) We all wish you success.

425
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:33,176
We will sacrifice to odin.

426
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,781
Are you not coming?

427
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:40,650
What?

428
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:46,022
I want you to come with me.

429
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,094
But the farm, the children.

430
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:54,664
Bjorn is still too young,

431
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:57,968
although he can help on the farm.

432
00:34:58,003 --> 00:34:59,769
But who is to be in charge?

433
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,106
Ragnar: The priest.

434
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,075
I will leave him with a key.

435
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:08,578
Father! You cannot place a slave above me,

436
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:09,913
your natural son.

437
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,952
Ragnar: I don't regard him as a slave.

438
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,754
He's a responsible person.

439
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:21,057
Please, Ragnar Lothbrok,

440
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:22,826
don't do this.

441
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:27,831
What do you think, Gyda?

442
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:29,933
Gyda: I don't mind. I like the priest.

443
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:31,701
Ragnar: (Smiles) Hmm...

444
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,236
Then it is decided.

445
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:50,587
If any harm befalls my children,

446
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:55,589
I will tear the lungs out
of your body, priest.

454
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,646
Are you really with us?

455
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:50,582
Understand this!

456
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:52,584
A war band lives...

457
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:57,856

or in front of you,

460
00:37:09,702 --> 00:37:11,903
you are already a dead man.

461
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:16,908
Knut: I am with you.

462
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,582
I made a mistake before
- I did not come with you.

463
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:27,552
Now I fear odin will make
a bad judgment of me.

464
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:33,225
For me, that's as important
as it is for you.

465
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,666
Just wanted to ask.
